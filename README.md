# 💙 Codo – Your Friendly Coding Companion

> Helping you fight impostor syndrome, one positive line of feedback at a time.

Codo is your kind, motivational sidekick that reads your code and reminds you of your progress, creativity, and potential. Whether you're just starting out or deep into your developer journey, Codo is here to highlight what you're doing right — because **you're doing better than you think**.

## ✨ What is Codo?

**Codo** is a coding companion that:
- Reads your code directly from your IDE or project folders
- Provides **positive, human-like feedback** on your coding style and structure
- Helps prevent **impostor syndrome** by recognizing effort, not just results
- Tracks your coding "wins" over time and celebrates growth

Think of it as a personal cheerleader for developers. Codo doesn't correct or criticize — it **encourages, motivates, and uplifts**.
